<h1> 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful effects homework</h1>

<p> I believe that artificial intelligence is both beneficial and harmful, but its misuse can be especially damaging. While AI can improve efficiency and accuracy in fields like healthcare and transportation, it also poses risks, such as privacy violations and job displacement. In San Diego, companies using AI for data collection may unintentionally compromise personal information, highlighting the need for stronger data protection policies. Additionally, over-reliance on AI in hiring processes can reinforce biases, making it harder for marginalized groups to access job opportunities. To prevent these harmful effects, it’s important to advocate for responsible AI regulations and promote ethical development practices.</p>

<h1>Digital Divide</h1>

<p> In San Diego, I’ve noticed that students from lower-income neighborhoods, like Southeast San Diego, often have limited access to personal laptops or stable internet connections, making it harder for them to complete schoolwork efficiently. Some areas lack public resources, such as libraries with reliable free Wi-Fi, leaving families without home internet disconnected. During remote learning, students with outdated devices struggled with slow performance, while those with newer technology had a clear advantage. I’ve also seen how older adults, especially in underserved areas, lack the digital skills needed to access essential services, like healthcare portals or job applications. To help bridge this gap, I can volunteer with local programs by teaching digital literacy or helping distribute refurbished devices to families in need. </p>

<h1>Computing Bias</h1>

<p>Popcorn hack #1: B since you are explicitly providing the user data about your name and other information </p>

<p>Popcorn hack #2: B since a system trained on an underrepresented dataset, such as people with darker skin tones, leads to poor performance for those groups, illustrating Data Bias.</p>

<p>Popcorn hack #3: Unintentional bias happens when someone unknowingly favors one group over another. For example, a teacher might call on boys more often than girls without meaning to, simply because of unconscious habits or assumptions.</p>

<p>Short Answer Question: </p>

<p>Implicit data is information collected indirectly from user behavior without the user explicitly stating preferences. For example, an online retailer tracking the items you browse or purchase over time infers your interests.</p>

<p>Explicit data is information that a user provides directly, such as filling out a survey or rating a product. For instance, when you rate a movie on a streaming service, you’re giving explicit feedback.</p>

<h1>Crowdsourcing</h1>

<p>Popcorn hack #1</p>

<p>Crowd Funding: People contribute money to support projects, helping innovators bring ideas to market (e.g., Kickstarter).</p>

<p>Crowd Creation: The crowd collaboratively creates content, products, or solutions, fostering collective innovation (e.g., Wikipedia).</p>

<p>Crowd Voting: Public votes or provides feedback, guiding decisions and highlighting popular ideas (e.g., Reddit upvotes).</p>

<p>Crowd Wisdom: The crowd shares knowledge or insights, solving problems through collective intelligence (e.g., Waze traffic updates).</p>

<p>Popcorn hack #2</p>

<p>Data crowdsourcing gathers large datasets through public contributions, boosting diversity, speed, and collaboration in open-source development.</p>

<p>Examples of Crowdsourced Datasets:</p>

<p>ImageNet: 14M+ labeled images for AI training.</p>

<p>Common Voice: Mozilla’s open-source voice dataset.</p>

<p>OpenStreetMap: Crowdsourced geographic data.</p>

<p>Popcorn hack #3</p>

<p>Distributed computing uses volunteers' devices to process massive datasets, speeding up research and innovation.</p>

<p>Examples of Successful Projects:</p>

<p>SETI@home: Searches for extraterrestrial signals.</p>

<p>Folding@home: Simulates protein folding for disease research.</p>

<p>BOINC: Supports scientific projects with volunteer computing.</p>

<p>Homework</p>

<p>Crowdsourcing plays a vital role in today’s age by harnessing the collective skills, insights, and resources of large groups to solve problems and drive innovation. It takes many forms, including crowd funding to support new ventures, crowd creation for collaborative content, crowd voting to guide decisions, and crowd wisdom to solve complex issues. Distributed computing further enhances crowdsourcing by using volunteer devices to process large datasets, accelerating scientific research and data analysis. Meanwhile, data crowdsourcing fuels open-source development by providing diverse, real-world datasets for training AI models and building better applications.As technology advances, crowdsourcing holds immense potential to transform industries, from healthcare and AI to climate research, by enabling faster, more collaborative innovation. </p>

<h1>Lists and Filtering</h1>

<p> Popcorn hack 1: </p>

<p> Lists are a versatile and efficient way to store multiple values in a single variable, allowing for easy access, manipulation, and iteration of data. They offer benefits like dynamic sizing, organized storage, and the ability to sort or filter items. Real-world examples of lists in code include to-do list apps, student grade tracking, inventory management, web scraping, and bank account transactions. Lists make handling collections of data simple, whether you're organizing tasks, calculating averages, or tracking changes over time. </p>

<p> Popcorn hack 2: </p>

<p> The code output is eraser </p>

<p> 1. The list items is initially ["pen", "pencil", "marker", "eraser"]. </p>

<p> 2. items.remove("pencil") removes the item "pencil" from the list, so the list becomes ["pen", "marker", "eraser"]. </p>

<p> 3. items.append("sharpener") adds "sharpener" to the end of the list, so the list becomes ["pen", "marker", "eraser", "sharpener"]. </p>

<p> 4. print(items[2]) prints the element at index 2 in the list, which is "eraser". </p>

<p> Popcorn hack 3: </p>

<p> Filtering algorithms are used in many real-world applications to sort through large amounts of data and highlight what’s most relevant. For example, search engines filter results to show the most relevant pages based on a user's query, while social media platforms use filters to personalize content and ads for users. Email services use spam filters to block unwanted messages, and recommendation systems like Netflix or Amazon filter through catalogs to suggest movies, products, or shows based on user preferences. These algorithms improve efficiency and enhance user experience by focusing on what matters most. </p>

<img src="/rheaStudent/images/listsfiltering2.png" alt="listsfiltering2" width="600" height="500">

<p> Steps to traverse the list: </p>

<p> Start with the first item in the list. </p>

<p> Use a loop (for loop) to iterate over each item in the list. </p>

<p> Access each item using the loop’s index or directly. </p>

<p> Perform any operation you need on the item (e.g., printing it, modifying it, etc.). </p>

<p> Continue to the next item in the list until all items have been processed. </p>



<p> Filtering Algorithm (Using Pandas): </p>

<p> Condition: Filter for fruits that contain the letter 'e' </p>

<p> Steps: </p>

<p> Start with a list of items (fruits in this case). </p>

<p> Convert the list to a pandas DataFrame for better manipulation. </p>

<p> Use list traversal (looping) to check each item. </p>

<p> Apply the condition: check if the item contains the letter 'e'. </p>

<p> Build a new list containing only the items that meet the condition (i.e., contain 'e'). </p>

<p> Final Reflection </p>

<p> Filtering algorithms and lists are used in real life to sort and refine data, such as when a search engine filters results based on relevance to a user's query. Lists help store and organize information, and filtering algorithms ensure only the relevant data is selected for display or further analysis. </p>
