Night @ The Museum Feedback: 

"The website frontend CSS styling looks really nice"

"The features are functioning and they look cool. There were a variety of features that were all interconnected to each other and it looks good."

"The website is very aesthetically pleasing and the profile picture was really cute." - Arshia (csp)

"i'm obsessed with the color scheme and the overall moral of the website. i like the censorship, making it accessible to all age groups and such. amazing work!!!!!!!"

"Very nice UI! The colors and CSS styling was very good! Good job guys"

College board MC reflection:

5. (C) With these inputs, the OR gate will produce an output of true and the first AND gate will produce an output of true. Since both inputs to the second AND gate will be true, the circuit will have an output of true.

7. (C) While some simulations are realistic, they are simplified representations of more complex objects or phenomena.

10. (B) This code segment initially sets cost to 6 (the cheapest possible ticket price), then increases cost by 2 for people whose age is greater than 12. Regardless of the person’s age, cost is increased by 2 for people going on a guided tour.

15. (A) Program A initializes i to 1. Inside the loop, it prints i and then increments i. The loop terminates when i is greater than 10, which occurs after 10 is printed. Program A prints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. Program B initializes i to 0. Inside the loop, it increments i and then prints i.

17. (D) At the lowest level, all digital data (including integers, alphanumeric characters, and machine language instructions) are represented with sequences of bits.

20. (A) The two line graphs are roughly the same shape. Each value on the right line graph is about 10 times the corresponding value on the left line graph. Therefore, the average amount of data stored per user is about 10 GB.

21. (B) The files that are up to 10 MB represent 17% + 24% + 25% + 10%, or 76%.

23. (D) The flowchart sets available to true whenever weekday is true and miles is less than 20, and sets available to false otherwise. This code statement provides the same functionality.

25. (C) Statement I is false. The Internet is not controlled from a central device. Statements II and III are true. The Internet uses redundant routing to support fault tolerance. The Internet uses protocols so that data is transmitted in a standard format.

29. (A) Lossless compression is a technique that allows for complete reconstruction of the original data.

30. (D) The string "out of range" could only be displayed if the condition n ≥ 1 was false. If the initial value of n is at least 0, then n will be incremented by 1, making n at least 1. Therefore the condition n ≥ 1 will be true and "out of range" will not be displayed. If the initial value of n is negative, then n will be multiplied by -1, making n at least 1.

34. (C) In this code segment, the first call to BotMover moves the robot forward one square, rotates it right one time so that it faces right, and moves it forward one square. The second call to BotMover moves the robot forward one square, rotates it right 3 times so that it faces toward the top of the grid, then moves it forward one square. 

35. (B) The procedures MaxTwo and MaxThree are each used to determine the maximum among a group of given values. A generalization of this procedure is Max, which takes a list parameter as input to determine the maximum of any number of values.

36. (A) The time required for a simulation to run is impacted by the level of detail used in the model. Generally, a simulation based on a less detailed model will require less time to run.

43. (C) It is possible to have redundant routing in both configurations. In configuration I, some possible routes between computers Q and V include Q-P-V, Q-T-V, and Q-R-S-V. In configuration II, some possible routes between computers Q and V include Q-S-V, Q-R-T-V, and Q-P-T-V.

45. (D) In this code segment, three coin flips are simulated, where one result is represented by 1 and the other result is represented by 0. The player wins when the sum of these is 0 or 3, indicating all heads or all tails.

50. For an algorithm to run in reasonable time, it must take a number of steps less than or equal to a polynomial function. Algorithm I accesses elements times (twice for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time. Algorithm II accesses elements (n times for each of n elements)

53. (C) This system uses an application to enlist the services of a large number of people to help find a lost pet.

56. (D) Version I calls the GetPrediction procedure once for each element of idList, or four times total. Since each call requires 1 minute of execution time, version I requires approximately 4 minutes to execute. Version II calls the GetPrediction procedure twice for each element of idList, and then again in the final display statement. 

Specific MC topics I struggled with: Evaluate and test algorithms and programs, developing and implementing algorithms, and investigating computing innovations.

Individual strengths and weaknesses Reflection:

Weaknesses: Understanding concepts of Deployment, asking teacher questions/for help, Time management

Strengths: Feeling comfortable asking group members when I have questions, coding organization and burndown lists (including comments frequently in my code), help group mates understand Unit 4 concepts and collegeboard videos more clearly, coming to office hours

Project Reflection:

- fixing the format of the MusicChatroom by getting rid of "id" and replacing it with the persons username/name
- find a way to match 2 users together who have the same music taste

strengths: Frontend is aesthetically designed,features are deployed, website is easy to navigate and the design makes everything accessible

Weaknesses: content maybe be limited if there aren't enough artists, interactions are only text based so users can't use video or voice messages, messages between users can be organized better so it may be hard for new people to follow along with the conversation

Honest Self Grade Assesment:

Deployment: 6/10 I still need to work on understanding the concepts better

API's/endpoints: 7/10 I understand the logic behind API's but it did take me a bit of extra time to get it to work in my frontend

CRUD functions: 7/10 my edit and delete button are functional, but I need to work on understanding the code of my CRUD functions better
