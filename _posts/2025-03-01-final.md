  <h2>Night @ The Museum Feedback</h2>
  <p>"The website frontend CSS styling looks really nice"</p>
  <p>"The features are functioning and they look cool. There were a variety of features that were all interconnected to each other and it looks good."</p>
  <p>"The website is very aesthetically pleasing and the profile picture was really cute." - Arshia (csp)</p>
  <p>"I'm obsessed with the color scheme and the overall moral of the website. I like the censorship, making it accessible to all age groups and such. Amazing work!!!!!!!"</p>
  <p>"Very nice UI! The colors and CSS styling was very good! Good job guys"</p>

  <h2>Travel Website</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Includes a map feature that shows different locations all across the globe</li>
    <li>Users can rate different hotels and look at other people's ratings</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>College Board MC Reflection</h2>
  <img src="/rheaStudent/images/finalmc.png" alt="finalmc" width="600" height="300">
  <p>5. (C) With these inputs, the OR gate will produce an output of true and the first AND gate will produce an output of true. Since both inputs to the second AND gate will be true, the circuit will have an output of true.</p>
  <p>7. (C) While some simulations are realistic, they are simplified representations of more complex objects or phenomena.</p>
  <p>10. (B) This code segment initially sets cost to 6 (the cheapest possible ticket price), then increases cost by 2 for people whose age is greater than 12. Regardless of the person’s age, cost is increased by 2 for people going on a guided tour.</p>
  <p>15. (A) Program A initializes i to 1. Inside the loop, it prints i and then increments i. The loop terminates when i is greater than 10, which occurs after 10 is printed.</p>
  <p>17. (D) At the lowest level, all digital data (including integers, alphanumeric characters, and machine language instructions) are represented with sequences of bits.</p>
  <p>20. (A) The two line graphs are roughly the same shape. Each value on the right line graph is about 10 times the corresponding value on the left line graph.</p>
  <p>21. (B) The files that are up to 10 MB represent 76% of the total.</p>
  <p>23. (D) The flowchart sets available to true whenever weekday is true and miles is less than 20, and sets available to false otherwise.</p>
  <p>25. (C) Statement I is false. The Internet is not controlled from a central device. Statements II and III are true.</p>
  <p>29. (A) Lossless compression is a technique that allows for complete reconstruction of the original data.</p>
  <p>30. (D) The string "out of range" could only be displayed if the condition n ≥ 1 was false.</p>
  <p>34. (C) In this code segment, the first call to BotMover moves the robot forward one square, rotates it right one time so that it faces right, and moves it forward one square.</p>
  <p>35. (B) The procedures MaxTwo and MaxThree are each used to determine the maximum among a group of given values.</p>
  <p>36. (A) The time required for a simulation to run is impacted by the level of detail used in the model.</p>
  <p>43. (C) It is possible to have redundant routing in both configurations.</p>
  <p>45. (D) In this code segment, three coin flips are simulated, where one result is represented by 1 and the other result is represented by 0.</p>
  <p>50. For an algorithm to run in reasonable time, it must take a number of steps less than or equal to a polynomial function.</p>
  <p>53. (C) This system uses an application to enlist the services of a large number of people to help find a lost pet.</p>
  <p>56. (D) Version I calls the GetPrediction procedure once for each element of idList, or four times total.</p>
  
   <h2>Individual Strengths and Weaknesses Reflection</h2>
  <img src="/rheaStudent/images/burndown.png" alt="burndown" width="600" height="300">
  <h3>Weaknesses:</h3>
  <p>I need to improve my comprehension of deployment processes, including troubleshooting (fixing problems), asking teacher questions/for help, and time management since it takes me more time to complete tasks than given.</p>
  <h3>Strengths:</h3>
  <p>Feeling comfortable asking group members when I have questions, coding organization and burndown lists (including comments frequently in my code), helping group mates understand Unit 4 concepts and College Board videos more clearly, coming to office hours.</p>

  <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
  <img alt="chatroom" src="/rheaStudent/images/chatroom.png" width="500" height="300" class="spaced-img">
  <p>Modifications that need to be made: Remove the "id" attribute from user objects and replace it with the "username" attribute to improve readability and maintainability.</p>

  <p>Implement an algorithm that matches two users based on shared values in their "musicTaste" list. This will involve iterating over user data, comparing common elements, and establishing a connection between users with the highest similarity score.</p>

<h2>Melodymates strengths:</h2>

<p>User Interface (UI): The frontend follows best practices for accessibility and usability, ensuring efficient navigation and engagement.</p>

<p>Feature Deployment: Core features are functional and deployed, demonstrating successful implementation of planned requirements.</p>

<h2>Melodymates Weaknesses:</h2>

<p>content maybe be limited if there aren't enough artists, interactions are only text based so users can't use video or voice messages, messages between users can be organized better so it may be hard for new people to follow along with the conversation</p>

<h2>Honest Self Grade Assesment:</h2>

<p>5 things done over the 12 weeks: 4.5/5 I stayed organized through issues and burndown lists but they could have been more thorough and detailed</p>

<p>full stack demo/ Night @ The museum Feedback: 1.45/2 While I was able to get my feature fully working, sometimes it took me longer past the deadline to get my feature functioning</p>

<p>Project feature Blog writeup (using CPT/FRQ language): 1/1 I used CPT/FRQ language throughout my blog which shows my understanding of these main ideas</p>

<p>MCQ: 1/1 I slightly improved compared to the last MCQ I took at the beginning of the trimester and this time I took more time trying to work through each problem</p>

<p>Final score: 8.5/1</p>

<h2>Future in Computer Science:</h2>

<p>Although I won't directly major in Computer Science, I will still use what I have learned and apply it to my field of study. For example, I learned a lot about working together with my group mates through problems we had and not giving up when errors came along the way. Aditionally, I learned how to problem solve and find different solutions.</p>

<h2>Feedback from Ms. Pataki:</h2>

<p>She suggested for the Artist reccomendation feature that we should allow users to edit their favorite artists after submitting</p>

<p>there should be a button to be able to change the color of the frontend to your liking</p>

<h2>CPT requirements:</h2>

<p>User Input: Users input messages so they can interact with people who have similar music taste and have artists in common</p>
