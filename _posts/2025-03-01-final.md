  <li>"The website frontend CSS styling looks really nice"</li>
  <li>"The features are functioning and they look cool. There were a variety of features that were all interconnected to each other and it looks good."</li>
  <li>"The website is very aesthetically pleasing and the profile picture was really cute." - Arshia (csp)</li>
  <li>"I'm obsessed with the color scheme and the overall moral of the website. I like the censorship, making it accessible to all age groups and such. Amazing work!!!!!!!"</li>
  <li>"Very nice UI! The colors and CSS styling was very good! Good job guys"</li>
  <li> "some text is difficult to read in some backgrounds and add some drop down menus" </li>

  <h2>College Board MC Reflection</h2>

  <p>5. (C) With these inputs, the OR gate will produce an output of true and the first AND gate will produce an output of true. Since both inputs to the second AND gate will be true, the circuit will have an output of true.</p>
  <p>7. (C) While some simulations are realistic, they are simplified representations of more complex objects or phenomena.</p>
  <p>10. (B) This code segment initially sets cost to 6 (the cheapest possible ticket price), then increases cost by 2 for people whose age is greater than 12. Regardless of the person’s age, cost is increased by 2 for people going on a guided tour.</p>
  <p>15. (A) Program A initializes i to 1. Inside the loop, it prints i and then increments i. The loop terminates when i is greater than 10, which occurs after 10 is printed.</p>
  <p>17. (D) At the lowest level, all digital data (including integers, alphanumeric characters, and machine language instructions) are represented with sequences of bits.</p>
  <p>20. (A) The two line graphs are roughly the same shape. Each value on the right line graph is about 10 times the corresponding value on the left line graph.</p>
  <p>21. (B) The files that are up to 10 MB represent 76% of the total.</p>
  <p>23. (D) The flowchart sets available to true whenever weekday is true and miles is less than 20, and sets available to false otherwise.</p>
  <p>25. (C) Statement I is false. The Internet is not controlled from a central device. Statements II and III are true.</p>
  <p>29. (A) Lossless compression is a technique that allows for complete reconstruction of the original data.</p>
  <p>30. (D) The string "out of range" could only be displayed if the condition n ≥ 1 was false.</p>
  <p>34. (C) In this code segment, the first call to BotMover moves the robot forward one square, rotates it right one time so that it faces right, and moves it forward one square.</p>
  <p>35. (B) The procedures MaxTwo and MaxThree are each used to determine the maximum among a group of given values.</p>
  <p>36. (A) The time required for a simulation to run is impacted by the level of detail used in the model.</p>
  <p>43. (C) It is possible to have redundant routing in both configurations.</p>
  <p>45. (D) In this code segment, three coin flips are simulated, where one result is represented by 1 and the other result is represented by 0.</p>
  <p>50. For an algorithm to run in reasonable time, it must take a number of steps less than or equal to a polynomial function.</p>
  <p>53. (C) This system uses an application to enlist the services of a large number of people to help find a lost pet.</p>
  <p>56. (D) Version I calls the GetPrediction procedure once for each element of idList, or four times total.</p>

  <li>asking teacher questions/for help</li>

  <li>time management since it takes me more time to complete tasks</li>

  <h3>Strengths:</h3>

  <li>Communicating with group members</li>

  <li>coding organization --> burn down lists (including comments frequently in my code)</li>

  <li>helping group members understand Unit 4 concepts and College Board videos more clearly</li>

<p>5 things done over the 12 weeks: 4.6/5 I maintained organization through issues and burndown lists, but they could have been more detailed and thorough.</p>

<p>full stack demo/ Night @ The museum Feedback: 1.5/2 I successfully implemented my feature, though at times, I exceeded the deadline to ensure full functionality.</p>

<p>Project feature Blog writeup (using CPT/FRQ language): 1/1 I effectively used CPT/FRQ language, demonstrating a strong understanding of key concepts.</p>

<p>MCQ: 1/1  I showed improvement from the initial MCQ, taking more time to analyze and solve each problem.</p>

<p>Final score: .9/1</p>

<h2>Future in Computer Science:</h2>

<p>Although I won't directly major in Computer Science, I will still use what I have learned and apply it to my field of study</p> --> 

<li>Collaboration</li>
<li> persevering</li>
<li>logical thinking</li>

<h2>Feedback from Ms. Pataki:</h2>

<li>She suggested for the Artist reccomendation feature that we should allow users to edit their favorite artists after submitting</li>

<h2>CPT requirements:</h2>

<li>User Input: This code receives user input from a JSON request, extracting the "message" and "user_id" fields, which are necessary for processing the chat message.</li>

<img alt= "userinput" src= "/rheaStudent/images/userinput.png" width="500" height="200" class="spaced-img">

<li>List/collection: This code retrieves all chat messages from the database, stores them in a list, and returns the list as a JSON response, demonstrating the use of list collections.</li>

<img alt= "listcollection" src= "/rheaStudent/images/listcollection.png" width="500" height="200" class="spaced-img">

<li>Procedure with Parameters: This function, censor_message(text), takes a string (text) as a parameter, processes it by checking for banned words, and returns a censored version, meeting the requirement for a procedure with parameters.</li>

<h2>Peer reviewing</h2>

<li>I peer reviewed with Drishya who is in CSA during office hours and had the opportunity to show him my feature</li>

<li> This experience made me feel more confident and prepared for the live review since I was able to get feedback from someone who has already taken csp</li>
