<h1>Crowdsourcing</h1>

<li><strong>Definition: Getting help or data from a large online community to solve problems or gather information.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

<li>Wikipedia, Waze, Duolingo, Foldit.</li>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong><li>

<li>Quick and low-cost.</li>

<li>Brings in many different perspectives.</li>

<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>

<li>Results may not always be accurate.<li>

<li>Quality control can be difficult. </li>

<h1>Legal and Ethical Concerns</h1>

<p><strong>Legal Issues:</strong></p>

<li>Copyright Violations: Using others’ content without permission.</li>

<li>Data Protection Laws: Regulations like GDPR safeguard personal data.</li>

<li>Hacking: Gaining unauthorized access is illegal.</li>

<p><strong>Ethical Issues:</strong></p>

<li>Informed Consent: Users should be told when data is being gathered.</li>

<li>Transparency: Tech should work in ways users expect.</li>

<li>Social Impact: Consider effects on jobs, privacy, and mental health.</li>

<h1>Safe Computing</h1>

<li>Create Strong Passwords: Use long, complex, and unique ones.</li>

<li>Enable 2FA: Adds another step to keep your accounts safe.</li>

<li>Use Antivirus & Update Software: Protect your system from viruses.</li>

<li>Watch for Phishing: Don’t click on sketchy emails or links.</li>

<li>Think Before Sharing: Be cautious about what personal info you put online.</li>

<h1>Binary Search Algorithm </h1>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>

<li>To quickly find an item in a sorted list.</li>

<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>

<li>Look at the middle value.</li>

<li>If the target is smaller, search the left half.</li>

<li>If the target is larger, search the right half.</li>

<p><strong>Efficiency:</strong></p>

<li>Time complexity: O(log n)</li>

<li>Note: Works only if the list is already sorted.</li>

<h1>Lists and Filtering Algorithms</h1>

<p><strong>Lists:</strong></p>

<li>A collection of items in a specific order (e.g., [10, 20, 30]).</li>

<p><strong>Filtering:</strong></p>

<li>Select items that meet a condition.</li>

<li>Example: scores = [92, 85, 70] → filter scores > 80 → [92, 85]</li>

<p><strong>Common Uses:</strong></p>

<li>Sorting values</li>

<li>Searching with specific conditions</li>

<li>Removing repeated items</li>

<h1>Simulation/Games and Random Algorithms</h1>

<p><strong>Simulation:</strong></p>

<li>Imitate real-world systems like climate models or disease spread.</li>

<p><strong>Games:</strong></p>

<li>Add randomness to make gameplay more interesting.</li>

<p><strong>Random Algorithms:</strong></p>

<li>Example: Monte Carlo simulations use random inputs to estimate outcomes.</li>

<h1>Big O & Algorithm Efficiency</h1>

<p><strong>Common Big O Types:</strong></p>


<li>Big O	Description	Example Use</li>
<li>O(1)	Constant time	Accessing one list item</li>
<li>O(log n)	Logarithmic time	Binary search</li>
<li>O(n)	Linear time	Looping through a list</li>
<li>O(n²)	Quadratic time	Nested loops (like bubble sort)</li>

<h1> MCQ Reflection</h1>

<img src="/rheaStudent/images/mcqq.png" alt="mcqq" width="600" height="300">

<p><strong> Overall Score: 45/70</strong> </p>

<p> 1. (D): Phishing is a technique that attempts to trick a user into providing personal information. In this case, the user is tricked by a fraudulent e-mail.</p>

<p> 4. (D): The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses protocols to connect devices worldwide. The World Wide Web is an information system (of pages, programs, and files) that is accessible over the Internet. </p>

<p> 14. (C) As is, the procedure traverses numberList from left to right and returns true whenever it encounters a value that is less than the preceding value. If it never encounters such a value, false is returned. </p>

<p> 16. (B) A no-rights-reserved Creative Commons license is used when the creator of a published work wants the work to be made freely available to everyone. </p>

<p> 19. (D) A strong password is something that is easy for a user to remember but would be difficult for someone else to guess based on knowledge of that user. Weak passwords can often be guessed based on publicly available information about a user. </p>

<p> 26. (A) The efficiency of a parallel computing solution is limited by the sequential portion of the solution. If each step is dependent on the preceding step, then each step must wait for the previous step to complete before executing. Therefore, the solution is completely sequential and does not benefit from parallel computing. </p>

<p> 32 (A) Public-key encryption is considered a secure way of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access. </p>

<p> 41. (A) Crowdsourcing is the practice of using input or information obtained from a large number of people via the Internet. In this case, input on a player is provided by other players of the game. </p>

<p> 43. (A) Keylogging is the use of a program to record every keystroke made by a computer to gain fraudulent access to passwords and other confidential information. </p>

<p> 50. (A) Symmetric encryption uses a single key for both encryption and decryption of data. Since the key can be used to unlock the data, it should be kept secret. </p>

<p> 53. (A) Step 4 checks every element of the list, incrementing count each time target appears. Step 5 prints true if and only if count appears multiple times in the list.

<p> 55. (C) This code segment assigns the value of the last element of the list to the variable temp, then removes the last element of the list, then inserts temp as the first element of the list. </p>

<p> 63. (A) and (D) When input1 and input2 are both true, the expression (input1 AND input2) is true, so NOT (input1 AND input2) will evaluate to false. In all other cases, (input1 AND input2) will evaluate to false, so NOT (input1 AND input2) will evaluate to true. </p>

<p> 64. (B) and (C) This line should be removed. This statement causes result to be assigned the value "adult", even if it should have been assigned the value "senior citizen". </p>

<p> 70. (A) and (C) This code segment assigns the characters to the left of position n to newStr. The code segment then concatenates newStr with the substring consisting of the characters to the right of position n. </p>
