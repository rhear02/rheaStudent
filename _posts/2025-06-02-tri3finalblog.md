<h1> MCQ Reflection</h1>

<img src="/rheaStudent/images/mcqq.png" alt="mcqq" width="600" height="300">

<p><strong> Overall Score: 45/70</strong> </p>

4.1 The internet

Packet: a small amount of data sent over a network. Each packet includes the source and the destination information.

Packet switching: the message (file) is broken up into packets and sent in any order. The packets are reassembled by the recipient’s device

Path: a path between two computing devices on a computer network is a sequence of connected computing devices that begins at the sender and ends at the receiver

IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force): manages the development of standards and technical discussions concerning the internet in an open process

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): establishes a common standard for how to send messages between devices on the internet

4.2 Fault Tolerance

The internet has been engineered to be fault tolerant, with abstractions for routing and transmitting data

Redundancy is the inclusion of extra components that can be used to mitigate failure of a system if other components fail

Redundancy within a system often requires additional resources but can provide the benefit or fault tolerance

The redundancy of routing options between two points increases the reliability of the internet and helps it scale to the more devices and more people

    <h3><span style="font-size: 20px;">Connecting to the Future</span></h3>

  <p> Now, I'm applying what I’ve learned in class to pursue my interests in engineering. My experience with Git, Python, and version control has become essential in a hands-on project where I’m building and managing a working prototype. Using CRUD operations, I’m able to efficiently organize and interact with project data. </p>
