The problems I struggled with were my python not updating. I had to reinstall and upgrade homebrew.
Also, I struggled with my localhost not working. I fixed it by changing the repository name and 
the make file. I also had issues with my baseurl in the browser as it just said student_2025 because I forgot to change it in the _config.yml
