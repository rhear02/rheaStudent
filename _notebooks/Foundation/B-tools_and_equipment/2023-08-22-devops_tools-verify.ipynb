    "## Computers and Terminals\n",
    "\n",
    "A brief overview of Terminal and Linux is a step on your way to becoming a Linux expert. When a computer boots up, **a kernel (MacOS, Windows, Linux) is started**. This kernel is the core of the operating system and manages hardware resources. Above the kernel, various applications run, including the **shell** and **terminal**, which allow users to interact with the system using a basic set of commands provided by the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, casual users interact with the system through a Desktop User Interface (UI) that is started by the computer's boot-up processes. However, to interact directly with the shell, users can run a \"terminal\" application through the Desktop UI. Additionally, **VS Code provides the ability to activate a \"terminal\"** within its editing environment, making it convenient for developers to execute commands without leaving the code editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this next phase, we will use a Jupyter notebook to perform Linux commands through a terminal. The Jupyter notebook is an application that runs above the kernel, providing an interactive environment for writing and executing code, including shell commands. This setup allows us to seamlessly integrate code execution, data analysis, and documentation in one place, enhancing our productivity and learning experience."

    "> Env(ironment) is used to capture things like the path to the Code or Home directory. Git and GitHub are not only used to exchange code between individuals but are also often used to exchange code through servers, in our case for website deployment. All tools we use have behind-the-scenes relationships with the system they run on (MacOS, Windows, Linux) or a relationship with servers to which they are connected (e.g., GitHub). There is an \"env\" command in bash. There are environment files and setting files (e.g., `.git/config`) for Git. They both use a key/value concept.\n",

    "- `env` shows settings for your shell.\n",
    "- `git clone` sets up a directory of files.\n",
    "- `cd $project` allows the user to move inside that directory of files.\n",
