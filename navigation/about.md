<p style="border:  2px solid red;"> Hi! My name is Rhea and I am a senior at Del Norte High school. I plan to major in computer science and attend four year university. I like going to the beach with my friends on the weekends and going to the mall. In my free time I enjoy reading and painting. I have a dog named lemon who is a maltipoo🐶 and two months old. I am very eager to learn more about computer science in AP CSP📙! </p>
